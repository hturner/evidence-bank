# RSE at Warwick

RSEs at Warwick are either based in Research Technology Platforms (centralised 
services) or embedded in academic departments.

Embedded RSE roles tend to be uniquely tailored to the needs of their host 
department. RSE roles in the Scientific Computing Research Technology Platform 
are more standard and these are the job descriptions we provide here. These 
job descriptions have been used as a base to create job descriptions for more 
customised roles, helping to benchmark those roles.
